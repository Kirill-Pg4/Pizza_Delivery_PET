# Pizza Delivery

This is my app for food and drink delivery. All the images and descriptions used in the app have been generated by AI Bing. If you open my repository, you'll see that my project incorporates **MVP (Model-View-Presenter), Kotlin, Firebase, and View/Data Binding, RecyclerView, Parts of asynchronous solves**, along with other intelligent solutions. The primary focus of my app is to facilitate food delivery and utilize the interaction capabilities of **Firebase**. This project has been a great training experience for me with Firebase work.
